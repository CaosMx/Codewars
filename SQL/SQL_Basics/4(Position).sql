-- SQL Basics - Position

/*

You have access to a table of monsters as follows:

monsters schema

    id
    name
    legs
    arms
    characteristics

In each row, the characteristic column has a single comma. Your job is to find it using position(). You must return a table with the format as follows:

output schema

    id
    name
    comma

The comma column will contain the position of the comma within the characteristics string. Order the results by comma.
